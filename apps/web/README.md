# Modern React 18 boilerplate using Vite + TS (SWC)

### Additional :=> Zustand + React-Query + (Vitest) @testing-library/react

#### How to use it?

> Using Git Clone. Go to your directory & clone there :=> `git clone https://github.com/0xMahabub/react-zustand-ts-swc`

> Using Degit. Go to your directory & do this :=> `npx degit 0xMahabub/react-zustand-ts-swc`

#### Recommendations:

> Node Version: `>=16.x` for vite requires `>=14.18.x` & some other reasons.

> Package Manager: `Yarn` my favorite. You can change it by removing `yarn.lock` file & `node_modules`. Then reinstall with `npm` or `pnpm`

#### Coming Soon.

> `.editorconfig` for all IDE's as a common misc/other setups

> `storybook/react` (Though I don't like that much :sad:)
